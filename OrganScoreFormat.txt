Organ Score Format

The Organ instrument is particularly easy to implement in a score file.  


The instrument works best when the first line initializes all possible components of the Organ instrument.
Since Organs have very short attack, decay, and release attributes, I assigned them to very small at
0.05 and 0.01.  The release should be particularly smaller since it's an organ.  These are fine to just be specified
once in the whole file.  Attack is simply how long the attack period of the notes are, while
the decay is the length of the decay. 

The drawbar is the same as the Step5 project, but only has to be initialized once. Each digit in the 
9 digit number represents a drawbar setting.

For every line afterwards, only the measure, beat, duration of the beat, note, and amplitude should be specified,
unless you want to implement a feature of the organ instrument.

Measure, beat, duration, note, and amplitude are very straightforward.  For this instrument it 
is best to have the amplitude be at 0.05 or 0.1.
