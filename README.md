# Project1_Synthie

To contribute -->

- Clone this project, this is the Synthie project standard (provided for us)
- Ideally, we would make branches and pull requests and things to make sure we're not stepping in eachothers toes like Owen outlines here

> https://facweb.cse.msu.edu/cbowen/cse335/git/

- Make changes (small features that compile) and commit them often!
- Push your changes.
- Once they look good, we'll merge everything into the master branch
